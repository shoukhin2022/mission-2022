            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>
                My mission to be a web developer is sum of certain goals and These goals are weekly basis. For example, first week is for learning all the basics of HTML, second week for CSS and so on. Every week, I will will be given assignment which defines how much
                I have learned effectively. After completing the HTML and CSS, my next goal will be to learn Javascript.

            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p>
                There are some strategies that would be followed to be successful in this journey. According to my mentor and my own experience, to achieve success in a field, I must practice the specified module everyday and finish it before the deadline. If I stuck
                with anything while learning, I can take help from the facebook group.

            <h3>Activities</h3>
            <p>
                Everyday I will go through some activities so that at the end of the day I can complete the module in time. I will start watching the video as soon as it releases at night and then next day in the morning, I will start practicing. First, I will finish
                practicing based on the videos and then I will practice further from W3schools, Youtube videos etc.
